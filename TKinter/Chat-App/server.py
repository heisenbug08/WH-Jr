'''
SOCK_DGRAM : used to create UDP Sockets
SOCK_STREAM: used to create TCP sockets

TCP: Transimission Control Protocol
  Tries to resend the packets that were lost during transmission. 
  Adds a sequence number to each packet and reorders them at receiver's end so that the packets do not arrive in wrong order.
  Execution is slower.
  Examples: HTTP, HTTPS, SMTP, FTP, etc.
UDP: User Datagram Protocol 
  Doesn't resend the packets that were lost.
  Packets can arrive in any order.
  Faster in execution.
  Examples: DNS, DHCP, etc.
